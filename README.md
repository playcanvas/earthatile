# Earthatile - 3D Maps for your Apps ðŸŒŽ

Earthatile is an engine-agnostic runtime for loading and navigating [3D Tiles](https://github.com/CesiumGS/3d-tiles/tree/main#readme) geospatial datasets. Use it to [create immersive 3D map experiences with Photorealistic 3D Tiles](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/maps-platform/create-immersive-3d-map-experiences-photorealistic-3d-tiles) such as flight simulators, explainers, games and more.

## Getting Started

Earthatile depends upon [Google's Photorealistic 3D Tiles API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/tile/3d-tiles). To access it, you need an API key. You can obtain a key by setting up a Google Cloud project with a billing account. You then need to enable the Map Tiles API. To learn more, see [Setup in Cloud Console](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/tile/cloud-setup). Once you have your API key, you can:
